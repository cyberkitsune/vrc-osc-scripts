# "Vosk"   - English Only, Slighty Better results Than Google, Runs Locally, Only use if you have Considerable cpu headroom, about 500 Megabytes of ram free, Best Results When Speaking Clearly 
# "DeepL"  - More accurate then Google Translate, but supports fewer langugages. It requires a token. (see below)

# Only leave this on if you're ok with your translation being very incorrect due to missing context.
